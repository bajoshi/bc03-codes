### Steps to get to the set of models to be used with the SED fitting code ###

0. Make sure GALAXEV-BC03 is installed correctly and working.
Read in the notes in bc03_notes.txt

1. Use the code bc03_extractspectra.py in GitHub repo bc03-codes
to convert the ised files to fits files. This isn't strictly 
necessary but I find fits files far more convenient to work with.
And also the remaining codes are written to work with fits files.

2. Use the function get_model_set() in massive-galaxies/codes/new_refine_grismz_iter.py
to generate the set of models to use with SED fitting.

2a. Make sure the *.*color files have been unzipped for the SSPs and the CSPs.
